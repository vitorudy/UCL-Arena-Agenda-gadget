    <h3>Introduction and assessment of a new robust peer-assessment in Engineering</h3>
        <p>Peer assessment has been gradually introduced at university level as it enhances students’ learning and development of critical skills. In this seminar a new peer assessment method, investigated in collaboration with Gwyneth Hughes (Institute of Education), which addresses the weaknesses of the traditional peer assessment and ensures that students engage and see it as a learning tool and an accurate and reliable way of assessing their work will be introduced. It promotes students’ discussion/support and engages them in the assessment of feedback which increases their learning and critical thinking. Following the student’s preferences, an online system is used and anonymity is ensured.

        UKPSF Areas:

        A1 Design and plan learning activities and/or programmes of study
        A3 Assess and give feedback to learners
        A4 Develop effective learning environments and approaches to student support and guidance
        K2 Appropriate methods for teaching and learning in the subject area and at the level of the academic programme
        K3 How students learn, both generally and within their subject/disciplinary area(s)
        K4 The use and value of appropriate learning technologies
        K6 The implications of quality assurance and quality enhancement for academic and professional practice with a particular focus on teaching
